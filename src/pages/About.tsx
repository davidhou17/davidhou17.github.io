                I'm a technical writer passionate about making complex technology accessible 
                through clear, user-focused documentation and educational content.

                With a background spanning developer relations, AI product development, and 
                educational technology, I specialize in creating content that bridges the gap

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-6 text-teal-dark">My Journey</h2>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My career began in traditional technical writing, but I quickly discovered my passion 
                for the intersection of education and technology. Over the years, I've worked with 
                startups and established companies to create documentation strategies that don't just 
                informâ€”they inspire and enable action.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                What sets me apart is my ability to think like both a user and a product strategist. 
                I don't just document what exists; I help shape what should exist to best serve the 
                people who will use it.
              </p>

                engaging, and effective for everyone.
